1. Write my own mean subtraction code that has an acceptable run time. - virtually
   done, it runs in the time it takes to drink a coffee which is better than the
   original at ~ length of my master's project.
	The code isn't complete and you do lose the first and last 25 frames from the data
   however there is a solid argument for removing them anyway - the RMS isn't going to be 
   as good. At least it's something - maybe try it later in python since it will be
   faster

2. Find the optimal value to average over by visual inspection and
   by investigating the minimum and maximum values of intensity.
	The following results were obtained using a modified version of the existing
	departmental RMS code - NOT the one I wrote for the same job.
	There is minimal visual differences between 300 and 500 seconds of averaging.
	At 100 seconds the film appears to be overall lighter in colour.
	MINMAX(sub_scans_100) = (-1642, 2468)
	MINMAX(sub_scans_300) = (-2780, 2827)
	MINMAX(sub_scans_500) = (-3031, 2550)
	This is shown in the range of intensities that are shown, all of the scans have 
	approximately the same brightness but 300 and 500 have much lower minimum 
	intensities (compared to the mean).
	
	The means of the three diferent time averaged arrays were as follows
	MEAN(sub_scans_100) = -0.035
	MEAN(sub_scans_300) =  0.014
	MEAN(sub_scans_500) = -0.502
	and the standard deviations:
	STDDEV(sub_scans_100) = 40.9
	STDDEV(sub_scans_300) = 80.0
	STDDEV(sub_scans_500) = 90.6
	So, in this case a longer time to average over led to a higher standard deviation.
	This suggests that the changes that occur are not periodic within the time
	series that we are dealing with? 
	
	Also, the standard deviations are much higher than the difference in the mean and
	the expected mean (assuming RMS reduces the average to zero) which is nice.

	For a more complete picture of the difference that the different averaging makes
	we can look at a histogram of the intensities for the different time averages.
	This file is currently stored here: 
		/home/40147775/msci/my_code/histograms.eps
	These histograms reveal that the intensity spread is much smaller for the 
	shorter time average. The peak also changes each time.



3. Cut off the messy data at the end of the time series. 
	From zero to 314 the images are as expected
	From 315 to 336 the data is not good
	From 337 to the end the data is as expected
	We would be losing around a quarter of the data if we were to remove everything 
	after it so it is neccessary to avoid analysis on this section or to top and 
	tail the data set and rejoin it - ensuring that no connections or links are made
	between the shocks in the time series.
	
	The messed up data has further reaching implications than just the immediate problem
	of whether or not to remove the data. Since a running mean subtraction is being utilised
	it is neccessary to consider the effects that the bad data will have on the frames 
	(25) that are on either side of the affected data. Removing everything that could
	be affected would result in the loss of 71 total frames (theoretically).

4. Contour the shocks based on their brightness in terms of standard deviations.
	The shocks have been contoured at levels of 50 and 100 (on the same plot) and then saved
	out for turning into a video later. The contour area has also been decrased by applying
	two different masks, one that is the shape of the umbra and another that is simply
	a rectangle, this helps to focus the field of view and make it easier to see what
	is happening.

5. Does light bridge intensity change after impact with the shocks?
	Let's start by examining a few light curves of pixels that are in the light bridge -
	if they show occasional spikes in intensity that could be the first indications	 
	that the shocks are heating them. it will however be neccessary to sychronize the 
	spikes with the frames to see if a shock is incident at that time.

	However the problem with this method is that we are actually pickng up the 
	shocks that pass over the LB as well as any potiential impacts with the LB.
	Sadly, i'm not sure how to isolate these.

6. Manually search the data set for frames where the shock does pass past the light bridge
   and for frames where the shock is reflected/interacts with the light bridge.

	Frame 32 - left umbra, play forward, the shock develops, spreads in a circular
	pattern until frame. The shock is interupted by the LB at frame 41 when there is
	a noticeable increase in intensity at the LB. The increase in intensity spreads 
	vertically up the LB over the subsequent frames.

	Frame 57 - left umbra, small cicrular shock front that impacts the LB in Frame 59
	/60. Intensity incrrease observed in the LB, shock stopped by the LB.
	
	Frame 73 - left umbra, shock hits the LB in frame 77, LB stops the shock and
	brightens.	

	Frame 90 -left umbra, area of high intensity just left of the LB. Playing through
	to frame 100 reveals that the shock has dissipated into a rough ellipitical
	shape, passing over the LB with no obvious change in intensity in the LB.

	Frame 135, right umbra, there is a shock front moving to the left, it spreads
	out until, by frame 140, it is roughly where the LB is however after this it
	dissipates without any unexpected temperature increases. (up to frame 143).

	Frame 156, left umbra, bright patch nearest the umbra, collides with the LB
	in frame 159 - there appears to be a temporary reduction in intensity.
	However, in frame 160 there appears to be a re-bound of the shock. This rebound
	continues to propagate to the 'south west' through the 160's. It seems that the
	rebound then interacts with another shock that is just beginnning to develop - 
	there is a flash of intensity around.

	Frame 171, left umbra, small area of very high intensity incident on the LB.
	It spreads out against the LB but doesn't pass through or change the intensity
	of the light bridge. The brightness simply seems to spread out along the length
	of the LB and fade.

	Frame 185, left umbra, moving to the right. The shock appears to collide 
	with the LB and dissipate, it doesn't pass through, the shock has dissapeared by
	frame 192.

	Frame 208 - right umbra, just beside the bottom two identifying LB dots. The 
	shock grows and expands, passing over the light bridge through to frame 222.
	The shock appears to merge with another shock in frame 212.

	Frame 225 - right umbra, this shows the collison of two shocks (frame 228-9).
	The resulting increase in brightness is similar to the increase observed when 
	a shock collides with the light bridge, frame 40 ish. The shock doesn't appear
	to pass over the LB and dissipates shortly after the shock merger.

	Frame 253 - this appears to show the evolution of two similar, possibly 
	connected events, one in the left umbra and the other just at the light bridge
	(right side). The brightenings appear and grow together until frame 258 
	when the right one fades- faster than the left.

	Frame 271 - right side of the LB (virtually in the LB). The brightness 
	increases quickly and spreads along the LB but doesn't really spread out 
	from the LB. It has traversed the LB and disssipated by frame 280. the light
	curve for this area of the LB is interesting too, it shows that the maximum 
	brightness in this section is over 300 (~ 4 sigma above the mean) and shows 
	that the brightness is below the mean before and after the spike in brightness.

	Frame 291 - two shocks begin to develop, one in the right umbra and one in
	the left. They both move toward the LB until 296 when they appear to collide 
	with each other without impacting the LB and by frame 300 they have disappeared.

	Data unusable from 309 to 348. It could be argued that some of the observations
	may be valid but I think it is better to only base results on data that we are
	sure is as reliable as possible.

	Frame 382, left umbra, shows a lower intensity shock front incidient on the LB.
	It dissipates very quickly, possibly before it really interacts with the LB.

	This probably isn't an exhaustive list but it does provide some examples of
	different behaviour. If differences in the shocks can be identified that will
	give the first indictions of parameters that affect the propagation of the shocks.

6b. Can we create a mark of the LB on the deeper scans? I will take 10 pixels of the
    light bridge and mark them in some way then paste those pixels into the sub_scan_300
    image.
	So, on the surface scan take the points (409, 470),(405,497),(405,455),(397,430)
	(418,432), (424,457),(432,476), (432,505), (420,509),(403,511).
	Then set these pixels to be more intense than the surroundings and, in
	theory they will stand out.
	This proved to be more complicated than i thought. The points need a rotation
	270 deg anti clockwise to line them up - the rotation is in the RMS code
	but I have no idea why? - Need to ask.

	After rotation the points match well to the expected area of the light bridge.
	So we can select some central points of the LB: (412,557), (414,545), (416,530)
	(416,510). From these points an average light curve for the LB can be found
	although it will be pretty crude since there is only 4 pixel intensities.

7. We have determined some of the shocks that appear to impact the LB. Can we revisit
   the light curve for the light bridge and associate some of the peaks with shocks?
	Using the four points as found at the end of 6b an average light curve can 
	be created.

	Frame 40 ish - there ought to be a brightening, there is, which is nice.
	The peak is around 42nd frame at an intensity of ~100.

	Frame 90-100 we are expecting no significant change to the light bridge 
	and indeed, the intensity (RMS) is around 0 +- 20 between 90 and 100
	however there is an increase up to around 50 by frame 106.

	Frame 160 - 190. Light curve appears roughly sinusodial

8. Exploring features of the overall LB light curve.
	The majority of the light curve displays an oscillating average brightness
	roughly between -100 and +100  (where the standard deviation of the image as
	a whole is 80). Also the oscillations seem to be relatively uniform for much 
	of the observation time, there is a period of increase followed by an 
	approximately similar size of decrease. Some exceptions are around 180-190
	frames where there are many more small oscillations. Some of the troughs
	of intensity also have a clear 'splitting' where there is a small increase 
	in brightness then a decrease but this change is much smaller than the overall
	 trends. 
		One of the biggest deviations from these otherwise constant oscillations
	is spike that occurs around the 275th frame - see observation of this frame
	above. The intensity increases to 319 - the highest in the data set. It is also 
	bordered on both sides by the two lowest values in the data set, around -170.
		After this large spike the oscillation isze appears to return to the 
	values observed in the first section if the data set.

	This is worth repeating with more pixels from the light bridge to see
	that the results can be replicated.

9. How far do typical shocks propagate? What does it depend on?
	For this it would be useful to have a temperature map. Most of the shocks seems 
	to only travel about 2/3 the distance of the small umbra but some travel much
	farther - some additonal insight is needed.

10. Take a pixel (or square of pixels) and plot the doppler velocity.
	Doing this for a 6 term gaussian for both the average profile and the area 
	of investigation produced a doppler shift that mostly hovered around +-3
	however there were 3 shocks that had DV's of ~ -30km/s - these need more 
	investigation.

	i) Do they go away by selecting a different section of the SP, away from LB?
	Selecting an  area of the quiet sun, (861,716) shows encouraging results,
	the velocities are between -0.5 and 2km/s  with no large spikes anywhere
	and what appears to be a random pattern.
	However, selecting a region in the umbra gives a large number of tall spikes
	typically around -30, not sure why.

	ii) Can they be recreated frame by frame?-ensuring the mistake isn't in the loop.
        Yes, yes they can. The lambda difference is consistent with different code
	so it's less likely to be a typo thing.

	iii) Does the gaussfit of the strange behaviour areas look normal?
	No, this is the problem, the really bad areas have a fit that doesn't even 
	resemble the shape we want. The gaussfit instead fits to the left hand side of the 
	profile and is constant thereafter. The problem can be fixed by setting estimates
	of the parameters in the call to Gaussfit to the values found for the quiescent solar
	surface. This 'forces' the curve to fit in the direction that is required for 
	the curve to represent the profile. The range of values of the LOS velocities is 
	now roughly 0 - 5 km/s. The most interesting thing is that although there is 
	velocity spikes outside those reported in previous papers, the positive value
	of the spike velocity implies a movement into the solar surface and then a rebound
	rather than a movment outward from the solar sufrace followed by a relaxation.
	Initial observations also suggest that the 'relaxation' takes place at a similar
	velocity to the initial movement - this might be contrary to expectation thus 
	will require a little further investigation. 

	The largest spikes in the data set occur around 40, 57 and 75 frames respectively
	and these are 3 locations where we notice the shock colliding with the light
	bridge - this is certainly encouraging and might provide a way to identify the 
	nature of future interactions: if there is a new data set a plot the LOS velocites
	might provide a way to select certain areas where collisions are likely for 
	further investiagtion. 


11. It seems there are 3 options for a shock interaction with a LB
	1. Ths shock passes over the LB.
	2. The shock hits and heats the LB causing DV towards the observer.
	3. The shock rebound from the LB -frame 156 +, - the LB doesn't appear 
	   to absorb much of the energy since it doesn't heat up.

12. How quiet is the quiet sun?
	We will assume that if the square of 51k+ pixels doesn't change significantly 
	over time then any of them should provide a good profile for the quiet Sun. 
	Since the only measure from the profile of the quiescent sun that is used in
	further analysis and determination of the LOS velocities (goo or bad though they
	may be) is the mean of the profile. So this section investigates the evolution 
	of the mean of the curve fit to the guiet Sun over time. If any significant 
	chnages occur across the time series (ignoring the area of bad data) then it will
	be neccessary to average over the whole time series in order to achive an better 
	estimate of the line core value of the quiescent solar surface.

	The solar surface has a mean profile core of 8542.0169 with a standard deviation 
	of 0.00349 (this is after replacing the bad data profile core values with 
	the mean core value of the data set.) CAUTION: mean in idl is NOT sufficiently
	precise for this calculation. Simply using mean returned a result of 8542.0039, 
	however this didn't look right on the plot. Including the command /double
	inside the call to the mean() routine changed the value of the mean that was
	returned to 8542.0169. This looks much better on the plot but it does have 
	obvious implications for other analysis carried out thus far. It will be 
	neccessary to recheck each previous time mean has been used (such as my RMS code).

	The determination of the mean and standard deviation of the line core in the 
	quiet sun allows determination of errors on the LOS velocities (or anything else
	that uses the data.) In the existing code it will be correct to replace the 
	exisiting mean_avg_profile with the new average mean. The results can then be 
	re-interepted.  

	Thankfully this has a largely unobservable effect on the LOS velocity plot, as in
	the instrument corrected (best version). It looks the same. 

	What is the physical size of the standard deviation? 
	We can take the standard deviation and use it to compute the doppler velocity - 
	this effectively provides an estimate of the noise level inherent from the 
	quiet sun (and ONLY the quiet sun - other sources no doubt exist). Doing this 
	results in a value of doppler velocity of 0.122 km/s. The oscillations in the 
	plot of doppler velocity across time are at least an order of magnitude larger,
	typical values fall between 1 and 5 km/s so the noise level due to fluctations
	in the quiescent Sun are much smaller than the observation.

	This is especially useful when looking at the range between 100 and 170 frames,
	there is a oscilltion that looks as if it could be noise but it is much larger
	than the current noise threshold though noise from other soucres should be 
	considered. 

13. Identifying the optical height of the heating in frame 41 in terms of the 75
    steps of optical depth.
	Around frame 59-61 the area of the light bridge (rotated for some reason) 
	the area of the light bridge that was previously noted to have an increased
	luminosity shows a temperature increase relative to the surrounding area.
	Hopefully by taking an x-y plot over time at 60th tau step will show 
	the shock propagating toward the light bridge?

14. Which correction makes the LB stand out best?
	The trouble here is that the LB is not the same as the umbra - it's much brighter
	 and convective so it seem that the umbral correction isn't correct. Likewise
	it seems wrong to claim that the light bridge is similar to the quiet sun, 
	especially given the turbluent and stronger nature of the magnetic field in 
	that area. This leaves the penumbral filter in this case, either that or 
	create a custom one to deal with light bridges but doing that from a single 
	data set may yield results that aren't transferable. Also, since we are unable
	to trust any or the corrections fully it will be difficult to get values of
	the absolute temperature. So the important quantity is the change in temperature
	between frames - this will be correct as an correction applied is not a function
	of time. For this reason we can simply pick the correction that allows the 
	light bridge to stand out best for presentations etc. 
	Should be noted here that the corrections are all a function of tau - a plot
	of what the different corrections look like would make a good plot for the 
	paper. 

15. Try to go back, find pixels that shocks cross away from the LB and examine those in
    the temperature inversions.
	By looking at marked_sub_scans[200:750, 210:860,9] there is intensity spikes 
	at a y value around 293 in both umbra. However, if we look at the temperature
	inversions for the whole range of x values right throught the amtmospheric 
	depth no visible heating is present either in the uncorrected data set or
	in the data set with the umbral corrections applied. I'm really not sure 
	why this is the case. I was expecting to see the intensity correspond to some
	kind of additonal heating. Unless it's the rotation again - that would be 
	annoying. Let's check:
	Data set is now 551 by 551 so the mid point is ~ (275,275) to undo the rotation
	in question reflect the y value about the point 275. 
		293-275 = 18
		275-18 = 257
	Using the y value of 257 fixes the problem, the hot spots appear where they 
	should and evolve roughly as expected so at least the intensity can be linked
	to the temperature in the uncorrected data set. The height of the temperature
	burst is such that when the umbral correction appears it is much harder to 
	notice the temperature variations - they are at the height of the hotter
	part of the umbra. - it might be neccessary to try to change the limits of the 
	display to allows the to show up.

16. Make time cubes for each of the shock events that interact with the light bridge
    and label them as event_frame_n where n is the first frame.
	It seems the scans have been rotated before the inversion so to change the 
	following coordinates into the coordinates of the inversion just take 
	200 from the x ordinate and 260 from the y ordinate.

	Frames 32 - 45: Centre of brightening is (403,548) in rms time cube.
	This events needs a slice inclinedat some angle - 45 would do.
	(403,548) -> (203, 288)
	Line location and atmosphere slice saved in my_sav_files/slice_403_548_45deg.sav	
	I don't notice the shock in this stepper and I'm not sure why - might be too low
	in the atmosphere and blotted out by the hotness at the bottom of the atmosphere.
	To check, look at the 41st frame of time and examine x and y as tau evolves.
	Saved in x_and_y_against_tau_frame_41.sav

	Frames 54 - 65: Centre of brightening is (402, 546) in the rms time cube. 
	This event really needs a slice inclined at 45 degrees.
	(403, 546) -> (203, 286)
	Line location and atmosphere slice saved in my_sav_files/slice_403_546_45deg.sav

	Frames 73 - 81: The evolution of the shock ought to be clear by taking a slice
	through (385,552) (rms scan) with the x value constant. A vertical line through
	(403,556) will show the shock spreading over the light bridge.
	(385, 552) -> (185, 292), (403,556) -> (203, 296)
	Taking the full x and y image of the 74th time step and then creating a stepper
	that moves over optical depth: The intensity pattern is noticable eveywhere- 
	the entire atmosphere is hotter than the surrounding area at the
	shock coordinates.
	Moving to frame 77 and looking at the light bridge: The Lb is hotter than the 
	surrounding umbra at depthscale steps from 56 to 74. So although the shock front is
	present throughout the full height of the atmosphere significant heating only seems
	to occur at lower atmospheric heights. Is this becasue the LB is much denser at 
	this height - or is this when the LB starts? If so this will give a good estimate
	of the height of the light bridge.
	

	Frames 90 - 102: Passes over light bridge at ~(403,556), 45 degree angle would
	be good.

17. Finding intensity values for the shock formation. The sub_scans_300 data as a mean  
    intenity of 0.014 and a standard deviation of 80. This must be rememebered when thinking
    about the value.
	Event 41: shock formation: (frame 33) (362,526,33) = 339
		: light bridge on collision: (frame 42) (406,548,42) = 290

	Event 77: Shock formation: (frame 72) (387,541,72) = 429
		: light bridge on collision: (frame 78) (407,532,78) = 103

	Event 90: shock formation: (frame 90)(387,541,90) = 376
		: light bridge on collision: (frame 100) (396,550,100) = -83

18. Finding the temperature of the shock as it forms (maximum value) and the temperature
    as it interacts with the light bridge. Use the slice through the atmosphere, through
    the shock for this. Note the temperatures are not correct in an absolute sense but 
    the ratio of the values is accurate - i.e. they are all wrong by the same factor.
	Event 41: shock forming (frame 33) (183,63,33) = 4416.5
		: at LB: (frame 41) (207,72,41) = 4390

	Event 77: shock forming (frame 73) (177,64,73) = 4248.3
		: at LB (frame 78) (208,72,78) = 4264

	Event 90: shock forming (frame 90) (185,63,90) = 4469.0
		: at LB (frame 99) (208,72,99) = 3612

	So even though the temperature of the shock formation is approximately similar across
	the different shocks the temperature at the light bridge is different. 
	As is expected, the shocks that show the most heating give the highest temperatures
	at the LB - obviously.

	Bu the heating seems independent of the temperature of the shock at formation.

 


19. Height at which the shock forms: Take the y-value of the maximum temperature at the 
    shock formation:
	All of the y values are either 72 or 73 - all the shocks form at the same height,
	suggesting that they all have similar energies (otherwise they would have shocked
	before that point or after). 

	So, all the shocks have the same temperature at the same height at formation.
	They are all roughly similar in terms of distance to the light bridge - 
	actually it would be quite reasonble to claim that they are all caused by the
	same event.

	So what seperates their interaction properties. I haven't been able to answer 
	question but a few suggestions are:
	- Differences in the magnetic fields associated with the shock fronts.
	- Differences in the speed of progagation
	- Variations in the Light Bridge over time.
